The CardsGame project is a simple game where four images are displayed simultaneously, some face up and some face down. The objective is to track the images as they change their position randomly and quickly, and then identify which images have changed their orientation.

## Description

In the game, four images are displayed on the screen. Initially, some images are face up while others are face down. After a short period, the images change their orientation randomly and quickly. The player's task is to identify which images have changed their orientation (from face up to face down or vice versa).
